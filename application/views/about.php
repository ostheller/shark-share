        <h1>What is Shark Share?</h1>
        <p> 
          Shark Share is a virtual tissue bank for all species 
          of Chondrichthyans (sharks, rays and chimeras) in an effort 
          to reduce sampling inefficiencies and facilitate global 
          collaboration. Often researchers are collecting samples 
          for critical research projects and by using the Shark Share 
          platform coordinated sampling approaches are more easily 
          arranged.

        <p>
          Currently the Shark Share Global database is only available 
          for members belonging to research institutions and government 
          agencies. Public access is not granted due to ethics 
          requirements around sample collection. For more information 
          please email <a href="info@sharkshareglobal.org">info@sharksharglobal.org</a>.
