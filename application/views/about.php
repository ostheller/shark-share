        <h1>About Sharkshare</h1>
        <p> 
          Working with the team at Collaborative Research Networks Ltd, the Shark Share Global program is specifically tailored for scientists 
          around the world. We recognize that of the 1041 known shark and ray species, 47% lack basic biological data needed to assess if 
          populations are at risk. Of the remaining 53% which we do have knowledge of, more than a quarter are considered threatened by human impacts 
          such as overfishing and coastal development. 
        </p>

        <h1>What We Do</h1>
        <p>
          Shark Share Global is an international foundation which hosts a novel database, linking scientists world-wide via the lodgment of 
          available elasmobranch tissue samples into an easily accessed online toolbox.

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Increase the efficiency of global shark sampling and research via the maximization of tissue usage</li>
          <li>Help foster meaningful collaborations between scientists, encouraging unique large scale, global and cross-disciplinary 
            projects</li>
        </ul>
