        <h1>What is Shark Share?</h1>
        <p> 
          Shark Share is a virtual tissue bank for all species 
          of Chondrichthyans (sharks, rays and chimeras) in an effort 
          to reduce sampling inefficiencies and facilitate global 
        collaboration. Often researchers are collecting samples 
        for critical research projects and by using the Shark Share 
        platform coordinated sampling approaches are more easily 
        arranged.

        <h1>Who can use it?</h1>
        <p>
        Currently the Shark Share Global database is only available 
        for members belonging to research institutions and government 
        agencies. Public access is not granted due to ethics 
        requirements around sample collection. For more information 
        please email <a href="info@sharkshareglobal.org">info@sharksharglobal.org</a>.
