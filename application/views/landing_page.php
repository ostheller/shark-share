        <h1>What is Shark Share?</h1>
        <p> 
          Shark Share is a virtual tissue bank for all species 
          of Chondrichthyans (sharks, rays and chimeras) in an effort 
          to reduce sampling inefficiencies and facilitate global 
        collaboration. Often researchers are collecting samples 
        for critical research projects and by using the Shark Share 
        platform coordinated sampling approaches are more easily 
        arranged.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently of the 1041 known shark and ray species, 47 per cent 
          lack basic biological data needed to assess if populations are 
          at risk. Of the remaining 53 per cent which we do have knowledge 
          of, more than a quarter are considered threatened by human 
          impacts such as overfishing, finning and coastal development.
           More than ever we need to understand shark and ray populations
            in order to adequately manage and protect populations. 
            As research scientists our team know first-hand Shark 
            Share Global will benefit not one species but all 
            species of sharks and rays. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The not-for-profit Shark Share Global was created in order 
          to establish an online database that will act as a paradigm 
          shift for shark and ray researcher globally. The database will 
          be an online platform helping shark and ray researchers share 
          and receive tissues collected out in the field during scientific 
          sampling. 
        </p>

        <h1>Who can use it?</h1>
        <p>
        Currently the Shark Share Global database is only available 
        for members belonging to research institutions and government 
        agencies. Public access is not granted due to ethics 
        requirements around sample collection. For more information 
        please email <a href="info@sharkshareglobal.org">info@sharksharglobal.org</a>.
        </p>
        <!--<h1>What we hope to achieve</h1>
        <p>
        By having an online presence, no longer will researchers 
        have to rely on personal communication or personnel 
        networks to source available tissue. In time, Shark Share 
        Global will help reduce the costs of travelling into the 
        field without limiting the caliber of research as samples 
        are available all at the click of the button. Additionally, 
        we hope to provide a platform encouraging global 
        collaborations, spanning vast geographic boundaries to 
        allow researchers to address issues facing the worldâ€™s 
        sharks and rays. We are also seeking to enable scientists 
        from underrepresented or developing nations by providing 
        access to a global platform, connecting members to 
        scientists on the cutting-edge of research, with well 
        established research facilities.
